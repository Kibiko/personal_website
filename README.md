## Introduction

Welcome to the design of my website. This website is used to showcase my projects, tech stack, skills and current interests. Feel free to send a message to kevinjunchan@gmail.com if you want to know more about the design!

I use the [React](https://react.dev/) library with [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the IDE.
